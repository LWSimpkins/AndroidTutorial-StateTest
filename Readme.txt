Following Android tutorials from https://www.youtube.com/user/slidenerd

Learned how to save data when app goes through state changes, by saving it in a Bundle object is onSaveInstanceState() and recalling the data using either onRestoreInstanceState() or the existing onCreate() method. 

Switched over to using Android Studio instead of Eclipse.
